%% psypub.sty
%%      Stanford Psychology APA style
%%      Modifications to Latex article style
%%
%%      3/31/92 
%%      This is the new version of psychpub.sty which implements
%%      several improvements and bug fixes. 
%%     
%%      Use this style for SUBMISSIONS to journals requiring APA
%%      format.   If you want APA format, but want figures, tables,
%%      and footnotes all integrated into your text, use the
%%      psypap.sty option.  
%%
%%
%%      This style makes several important changes to LaTeX's article 
%%      style.  It is meant to be used as an optional style as follows:
%%              \documentstyle[psypap]{article}
%%
%%      You may use psypap in conjunction with most other style
%%      options.  E.g., [11pt,times,psypap].
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% doublespacing
%%      APA style submissions should be doublespaced.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.8}
%% from doublespace.sty
%% Single spacing should not be necessary for APA submissions,
%% but it's here if needed.

%% Headers and Footers
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Based on fancyheadings.sty
% We have eliminated head and foot rules, but maintained most
% of the functionality.  Even though only right heads are used
% in APA format, I've left the other head and foot commands
% available, since they are nice to have for drafts. -MAM

%% Section headings
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The default is to handle 3 levels of sectioning.  APA heading styles
% change slightly depending on whether 3 or 4 levels of headings are
% used in a paper.  To use 4 levels of headings, specify psy4lev as a
% \documentstyle option before psypap.

% APA Level 2
% change Section heading to large, centered
\renewcommand{\section}{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}{3.5ex plus
1ex minus .2ex}{2.3ex plus .2ex}{\large\bf}*}

% APA Level 4
% change Subsection heading to large, italic, flushleft
\renewcommand{\subsection}{\@startsection{subsection}{2}{\z@}{3.25ex
plus 1ex minus .2ex}{1.5ex plus .2ex}{\large\it}*}

% APA Level 5
% change Subsubsection to normalsize, italic, run-in
\renewcommand{\subsubsection}{\@startsection{subsubsection}{3}{\parindent
}{-3.25ex plus -1ex minus -.2ex}{-1.0em}{\it}*}

%% Figures and Tables

%% Author Notes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This is derived from endnote.sty.  As currently implemented, the
% \authornote command can be issued anywhere between the
% \begin{document} and \end{document}.  It's argument is the text of
% the author notes and can be multiple paragraphs.  The text will
% appear on an Author Note page at the end of the manuscript in the
% position designated by APA style.
% 
% This command is NOT a standard LaTeX command so it will probably not
% work in other styles.  An alternative way to produce author notes is
% to make them a new section following any appendices.  After the
% bibliography, \section is redefined to start a new page, so
% \section{Author Notes} works.
%
% A better future solution may be to let the \thanks
% command produce author notes, but there are some problems with this.
